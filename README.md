<h2>My Journey -- From Then to Now 🗺️</h2>
<h4>I've loved technology ever since I was a kid. This section will be listing things that I've worked on over the years and the experience I've gained along the way. This section will likely go through many updates as I remember things. I hope you enjoy getting to know more about me and don't cringe too much at the beginning sections.</h4>

<h4>It all started out with my iPad 2. The year is 2011 and I'm in 1st grade. It was the first device I could call my own. In those early years, I'd pretty much used it to take pictures, play Minecraft PE, and watch my favorite YouTuber at the time: Stampylongnose. I was obsessed with Minecraft and creating things.</h4>

<h4>Somewhere in 3rd grade our school let us use Chromebooks. This is when I started getting "creative" with technology. I established the now defunct brand of "M.C.B. Productions". Using my Google account, I created a document that contained hyperlinks to other documents. I call it the "MCB Web Computer". While literally being just a document with hyperlinks, I was proud of it, but knew it was very limited. I had no clue how to make something better. Additonally, I got Minecraft: Java Edition during this time. I played it on my late father's MacBook.</h4>

<h4>In fourth grade we were assigned Chromebooks full-time. My friend showed me how he got around the web filter by killing some extensions in the Chromebook task manager. I was utterly shocked at how he could "exploit" the operating system like that. This got me thinking out of the box. My greatest innovation at the time was called "Community Chat". Since our school Google accounts had Gmail, Hangouts, and all other social things blocked, it was hard to talk with friends. I created a Google document and shared it with around many people in the school. And oh boy, it a hit! You pretty much typed your name and then your message. In my mind, it was genius since it was easy to access (through Drive's shared tab), and couldn't be blocked (since it was through Google Docs). Here's a recreation of it:</h4>

<h4>Teachers caught on about 2 weeks in and forbid us from using it. It was sad since it was never used for nefarious purposes. It was seriously just a way to talk with friends.</h4>

<h4>In 5th grade, I recieved a 2015 MacBook for my birthday. From there I started using Google Sites to make my own versions of Google services. While obviously having very limited success, my friends used the sites. Here's a screenshot of my YouTube "competitor", creatively named "YourTube"... yeah, totally not getting sued for that one. To be fair, I'm still in Elementary School at this point. And no, I didn't own any domains at the time.</h4>

<h4>Being inspirated from creators like Stampylongnose and his friends, I wanted to start creating YouTube videos too. My wish would be granted in Christmas of 2015 when my parents got me a Blue Yeti microphone. I created my YouTube channel the same day. I slowly fell in love with creating Minecraft content, even if it was quite subpar.</h4>

<h4>In 6th grade I had no idea how to code, but I wanted to make things. Still being interested with operating systems, I created "StudentOS", which was a Google Drawings document that contained pictures and shapes that resembed a desktop. It had hyperlinks to school related things such as our grades portal, home page, etc. It was basically one of those Chrome "launcher" extension pages, but much worse. One of my teachers liked it and I ended up making one for a handful of peers.</h4>

<h4>Everything had been leading up to this point. Finally, after all this time, I would code my first project. My father was in the hospital and my mom and I would visit for a long time every day. I knew Google Drawings was a terrible platform for what I was trying to do, so I went on W3schools and made my first website which was virtually the same concept. It was indefinately my best creation yet, featuring a "app" that allowed students to write down their homework. What they wrote would save to local storage so they could check it later. While being coded horribly bad (I was literally saving the whole HTML element...), I was slowly learning. Here's a screenshot of the last version:</h4>

<h4>I felt like I had hit a barrier with it, mainly because I still didn't know how to properly code.</h4>

<h4>Somewhere in 2017 I founded my first Minecraft: Java Editon server called "Ender Galaxy". While being a bit subpar, I learned a lot about configuring plugins, managing a community, and problem solving. It was sadly shut down after my friends had a bit of a falling out. I really wasn't THAT bad, just felt like a 7th grader was running it... which indeed was the case. Months of work was put into the server by me and my friends. I also had a Forge server that my friends and I would record Minecraft roleplays on. Those servers will always hold a place in my heart.</h4>

<h4>In 2018 I really tried to focus on my YouTube channel, grades, and social life. Still wanting to do servers, I created a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition realm called Vexel Games with my friend Nick. It was honestly really good. It sadly had to be shut down in 2019 for a multitude of reasons, one of which being performance. The world was very laggy as we had many command blocks running on Mojang's subpar hardware. Additionally, I wanted to do more with it. Things that could only be done with Java Edition server plugins.</h4>

<h4>In late 2019 I took a computer science course at my High School. I learned the fundimentals of the Java language and made some interesting projects with it. I also created a Discord bot called Vexa that was written in Python. I sadly lost the code for it when I reinstalled MacOS on my MacBook. It was pretty good.</h4>

<h4>In April of 2020 I was back at it again with Minecraft servers. Understanding the pitfalls of my last one and having a greater maturity, I created Vexel Games: Java Edition. This is also when I bought my first domain! A few months later, a representative of the longstanding SouthHollow network reached out to me for a potential partnership. I ended up merging Vexel Games with SouthHollow and the rest is history. I've learned an absolute ton about Linux, system administration, using protocols like SSH and FTP, etc.</h4>

<h4>So far in 2021, I've been getting back into Java. I'm working on some private plugins for the SouthHollow network. While still being in the early stages, I've working on a public world management plugin called Voyage. Additionally, I'm creating a new Node.js project called Ruxlit. It will hopefully a platform that I can use to experiment with. So far I have a web server, API, Discord Bot, and very early stage chat bot working in the project.</h4>

<h3>There's still a lot I don't know, but I'm quite happy with my progress. I hope you can see I'm a person of passion and strong work ethic. I love what I do and hope to inspire others to get interested in what I do.</h3>
